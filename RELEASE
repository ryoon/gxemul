Version 0.1.1 of the emulator was released at 2004-07-02.  The next 
stable release will probably not happen very soon, as there are lots of 
things I'd like to experiment with that might make the code unstable.

I'll probably call the next release 0.2, since it will be different enough
from the 0.1 and 0.1.1 releases to warrant a big version increase.


These were the 0.1.1 release notes:

Release notes for mips64emul 0.1.1
==================================

Copyright (C) 2003-2004 by Anders Gavare  (md1gavan@mdstud.chalmers.se)


0.1 is the first official release of mips64emul. 0.1.1 contains a few 
minor updates.

mips64emul is a MIPS machine emulator. The goals are to emulate 32-bit and
64-bit MIPS-like CPUs and enough surrounding hardware to fake real machines,
capable of running real (unmodified) operating systems, such as NetBSD or
Linux.

(MIPS is a registered trademark of MIPS Technologies. This project is not
affiliated with MIPS Technologies in any way whatsoever.) 

In mips64emul's current state, a DECstation machine is emulated well enough
to let NetBSD/pmax install itself onto a harddisk image, in a manner very
similar to how an install is performed on a real physical DECstation.
(Ultrix/RISC is also possible to install this way.)

Other machine types are also emulated, but not well enough yet to let an
entire OS be installed.


This release has a number of known bugs, listed in the BUGS file, but feel
free to drop me a line regarding other bugs.


Files included in this release are:

  RELEASE            This file.

  README             Contains quick start instructions, for the impatient ones.

  LICENSE            Copyright message / license.

  HISTORY            Revision history/changelog.

  TODO               TODO notes.

  BUGS               A list of known bugs.

  src/, devices/,    Source code.
  and include/

  doc/               Documentation.

  tests/             Regression tests.

  experiments/       Experimental code (not needed by the emulator itself).


and a configure + Makefile.skel combination for configuring and building the
emulator.

The following platforms and compilers have been used to build the emulator; not
all of them have been tested for this specific release, but will most probably
work anyway.

	FreeBSD/alpha 4.9
		gcc version 2.95.4 20020320 [FreeBSD]
		gcc version 3.3.1 [FreeBSD]
		gcc version 3.4 20030730 (experimental)
		ccc 6.4.9.005-1

	Linux/i386
		gcc version 3.2.2 20030222 (Red Hat Linux 3.2.2-5)
		gcc 3.3.4 (Linux-2.6.7, Slackware)

	OpenBSD/i386 3.2
		gcc 2.95.3 20010125 (prerelease)

	OpenBSD/sparc64
		gcc 2.95.3 20010125 (prerelease, propolice)

	Solaris/sparc (SunOS 5.9)
		cc Sun WorkShop 6 update 2 C 5.3 Patch 111679-12 2003/05/18
		gcc version 2.95.3 20010315 (release)

	NetBSD/pmax 1.6.2  (inside the emulator itself)
		default gcc (2.9x.y) seems to work

	NetBSD/i386 2.0/-current
		gcc 3.3.3

	HP-UX B.11.00
		gcc 3.3.2  (this works, but HP-UX default cc doesn't work)

	Ultrix/MIPS  (inside the emulator itself)
		(default cc does NOT work)


Only a few files in the include/ directory are written by me, the rest are
from other sources (such as NetBSD).  The license text says that "All
advertising materials mentioning features or use of this software" must
display acknowledgements.  Even though I do NOT feel I mention features or
use of the header files (the "software") in any advertising materials, I am
still very greatful for the fact that these people have made their files
freely available, so I guess thanking them like this is in order:
