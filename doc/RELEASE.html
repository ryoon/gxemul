<h1>Release notes for GXemul 0.6.1</h1>

<p><i>Copyright (C) 2003-2018  Anders Gavare</i>

<p><br>GXemul is a framework for full-system computer architecture emulation. 
Several processor architectures and machine types have been implemented. 
It is working well enough to allow <a href="guestoses.html">unmodified
"guest" operating systems to run inside the emulator</a>,
as if they were running on real hardware.

<p>The emulator emulates (networks of) real machines. The machines may consist
of ARM, MIPS, Motorola 88K, PowerPC, and SuperH processors, and various 
surrounding hardware components such as framebuffers, busses, interrupt 
controllers, ethernet controllers, disk controllers, and serial port 
controllers.

<p>The <a href="index.html">documentation</a> lists the machines and
guest operating systems that 
can be regarded as "working" in GXemul. The first guest operating 
system that worked in GXemul was
<a href="guestoses.html#netbsdpmaxinstall">NetBSD/pmax</a>, and that is
still one of the guest OSes that works best.



<p><br>The most important change between release 0.6.0.2 and 0.6.1 is:

<!--
<p>Old framework:
-->
<ul>
	<li><b>SGI O2 emulation (in the Old framework):</b>
	<ul>
		<li>Graphical framebuffer:
		Previously, only serial console was possible when
		running NetBSD/sgimips as a guest OS, but now it is
		also possible to use graphical framebuffer for both
		text console and for X11.

		<li>OpenBSD/sgi has been moved from "unsupported" to
		supported.
	</ul>
</ul>

<!--
<p>New framework:
<ul>
	<li>...
</ul>
-->


<p><br>Please read the HISTORY file for more details.

<p>To build the emulator, run the <tt>configure</tt> script, and then run 
<tt>make</tt>. This should hopefully work on most Unix-like systems, with few
or no modifications to the source code.

<p>Regarding files in the <tt>src/include/thirdparty/</tt> directory:
most of these are from other open source projects such as NetBSD. See individual
source files for details, if you plan to redistribute GXemul in binary form,
or reuse the source code.
